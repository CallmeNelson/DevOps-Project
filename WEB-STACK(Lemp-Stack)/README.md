## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (Lemp Stack)

Let's dive into the architecture of the Lemp stack, understanding how Linux provides a solid foundation, Nginx serves as a powerful web server, MySQL handles the database, and PHP empowers server-side functionality.

Throughout the course/project,we will set up a Linux environment, configure Nginx for optimal performance, manage MySQL database, and develop PHP code to bring application to life. Through the practical and hands-on exercises, you will gain proficiency in building dynamic websites with the LEMP stack. We will explore techniques for handling user requests, interacting with database, processing forms, and implementing robust security measures.

In this project you will implement a similar stack, but with an alternative Web Server - **NGINX**, which is also very popular and widely used by many websites in the internet.

### SIde Self study

1. Make yourself familiar with basic **SQL syntax and most commonly used commands**

2. Be comfortable using not lony VIM, but also **Nano editor** as well, get to know **basic Nano commands**.

### Step 0 - Preparing prerequisites

In order to complete this project you will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu OS.

**Hint:** There is simpler way that do not require conversion of **.pem** key to **.ppk** - using **Git Bash**.

Download and install Git Bash, then launch Git Bash and run the following command:

â€¢ ssh -i <Your-private-key.pem> ubuntu@<EC2-Public-IP-address>
