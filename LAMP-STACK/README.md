## Web Stack Implementation ( Lamp Stack ) In AWS

As you kick off your career in DevOps,you will soon realise that everything you will be doing as a DevOps engineer is around software,websites,applications etc. And,there are different stack of technologies that makes different solution possible. These stack of technologies are regarded as **WEB STACK**. Example of web stack include **LAMP**, **LEMP**, **MEAN**, and **MERN** stacks. As you proceed in your journey, you will be required to understand and implement all of these technology stacks. Lets have a short close up on what a Technology stacks is.

## What Is a Technology Stacks?

A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software. They are acronymns for individual tectnologies used together for a specific technology product. Some examples are....

• **LAMP** ( Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl )

• **LEMP** ( Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP, or Python, or Perl )

• **MERN** ( MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS )

• **MEAN** ( MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS )
